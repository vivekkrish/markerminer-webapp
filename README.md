MarkerMiner is a bioinformatic workflow and [webapp](https://bitbucket.org/vivekkrish/markerminer-webapp) that was designed to identify putatively orthologous single-copy nuclear loci present in two or more user-provided angiosperm transcriptome assemblies (e.g. [OneKP](http://onekp.com) transcriptome assemblies). MarkerMiner outputs detailed tabular results and sequence alignments for downstream assessments of phylogenetic utility, locus selection and intron-exon boundary prediction, and primer or probe development for targeted sequencing (see Godden and Jordon-Thaden et al. 2012).
